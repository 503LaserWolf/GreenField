There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Book Swap


## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  This product is for avid readers who want to swap some old books that they no longer want.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Book Swap is a web-application for people who love to read, and have books they've been meaning to get rid of. Finished a book and ready for something new? That's where Book Swap comes in. We make the connection between the user who wants a book and the user who has that book so that the two of you can trade.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Book Swap solves the problem of books accumulating that you no longer want.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  When you add a book to your "Have" book list, it is stored in our database so that when a user comes along and searches for that book, they will be connected to you. At this point, you can choose a book from their haves list, and your emails are released to one another.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "I thought there should be a way for people to connect with one another based on the books they read, and trade with one another so they could read even more, all the while saving the planet by reducing waste. That's why I made Book Swap!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Getting started is easy. Sign up securely on our signup page, log in, and add books by ISBN to your "Have" book list. You can then use the search bar in order to look up a book that you want to trade. If the book is in anyone else's "Have" book list, you can initiate a trade. They will then receive your book list and decide whether they are interested in swapping from your list, and your e-mails will be released to one another so that you can trade.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Great concept. It's now so easy to swap books and make friends with people based on your taste in books!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Now it's your turn to give it a try! Visit the Book Swap app to start trading.
