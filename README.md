## Usage

> Users create an account and log in, from there a user can add books to their account via the ISBN of any books they want to trade and can in turn search for books that other users have to offer. Currently there is no in house communication system and users must communicate via their private email services. We utilize the GoogleBooks API to get back book data via the ISBN and store that data in a MYSQL database for future use.
